# CS360 Lab 4
Threading

## Dependencies
* gcc
* make

## Running the Program
To get started, first compile the project by running `make`. This will compile the two programs into the bin directory.

From there, `cd` into the bin directory and run either file. These aren't too exciting and just use threading to solve a system of linear equations.
